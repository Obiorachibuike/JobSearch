                              <li><strong>Residential Communities:</strong> Japanese neighborhoods often foster a sense of community, with residents participating in local festivals, events, and neighborhood associations (chonaikai).</li>
                              <li><strong>Rental Housing:</strong> Renting is common in Japan, especially in urban areas where property prices are high. Rental properties range from small apartments to larger homes and are often managed by real estate agencies.</li>
                              <li><strong>Home Ownership:</strong> While home ownership rates in Japan are relatively high, especially among older generations, younger generations are increasingly opting for renting due to factors like financial constraints and lifestyle choices.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>Overall, Japanese housing reflects a balance between tradition and modernity, with a focus on practicality, efficiency, and harmony with the surrounding environment.</p>
